      <p>As this is an enemy randomizer, there may be some unexpected results when playing. I have attempted to ensure no quests or events are broken by this mod, but you may find that certain areas are much tougher or easier than you've found before, and there may be enemies that require magical weapons or specific elements to defeat before you have them. If required, you can re-install the mod components and that will re-randomize the monsters. If you think that the randomizer has changed an enemy that shouldn't have been, or hasn't changed any enemy that you think it should, please let me know the enemy/map and I can look into it.</p>

      <p> Tired of fighting the same mooks every time you play Baldur's Gate? The enemy randomizer alters the placement of unimportant (enemies with no quests, dialogue or events) to provide a fresh experience each time you play. There are a few components to allow some customization of the changes made. Steps have been taken to keep the strength of enemy encounters roughly the same, though it is possible to run into enemies with special abilities or resistances earlier than you might expect, so be prepared for anything!</p>

      <p>First time installing a mod? Check out G3's comprehensive tutorial:  <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player%E2%80%99s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A New Player’s Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG<br>
        </strong>Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that WeiDU, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must  run a program called <a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/71305/mod-dlc-merger-merge-steam-gog-sod-dlc-or-custom-dlcs-with-the-main-game">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation  before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br>
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game, you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br>
        Enemy Randomizer for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-MyMod.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> MyMod</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-MyMod.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-MyMod.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>macOS</strong><br>
        Enemy Randomizer for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-MyMod</strong>, <strong>setup-MyMod.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> MyMod</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-MyMod.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-MyMod.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br>
        Enemy Randomizer for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.  Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility"><abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr></abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in  <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall mymod' in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br>
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-gaEnemyRando --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

      <p>The mod contains several components that can be installed independently of one another:</p>
      <p><strong>Spawn Point Randomizer</strong><br></p>
      <p>This component randomly chooses new monsters for all of the spawn points in the game. This will be most noticeable in the wilderness maps of Baldur's Gate 1, but does affect Baldur's Gate 2 as well. For Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition and EET, there is the option to include Siege of Dragonspear monsters in the new monsters selected.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Rest Encounter Randomizer</strong><br></p>
      <p>This component randomly chooses new monsters for the rest encounters in the game, excluding indoor/city maps where you normally don't get attacked. For Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition and EET, there is the option to include Siege of Dragonspear monsters in the new monsters selected. For Baldur's Gate 2 and EET, there is the option to include or exclude the starting dungeon of SoA.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Set Creature Randomizer</strong><br></p>
      <p>This component randomly chooses new monsters to replace ones that are normally fixed, excluding anything that has dialogue, key items, or is related to a quest. Enemies are generally replaced by creatures similar to them in power level, so you should not find encounters impossible to beat. For Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition and EET, there is the option to include Siege of Dragonspear monsters in the new monsters selected. Including SoD monsters in the randomization will also randomize them on the SoD maps. For Baldur's Gate 2 and EET, there is the option to include or exclude the starting dungeon of SoA.</p>

      <p>The modding community for the Infinity Engine has been going strong for
        more than 10 years now, and is the culmination of thousands of unpaid modding
        hours by fellow fans of the game. Modders produce their best work and players
        get the best, well-supported mods when we all work together. </p>
      <p> There are two big ways to upset this harmony. One is to claim someone else's
        work as your own. The second is to host and redistribute a mod without permission
        from the author(s). </p>
      <p> Be kind to your fellow players and modders. Don't do either. </p>
